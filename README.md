The **Hotel Reservation System** is a comprehensive and user-friendly platform designed to streamline the hotel booking process for three distinct user roles: **System Admin**, **Hotel Admin**, and **Clients/Users**. This system empowers each user to efficiently manage their respective tasks and interactions within the hotel reservation ecosystem.

## System Admin
The **System Admin** is the central authority responsible for overseeing the entire hotel reservation system. Their roles and functionalities include:

- **User Management:** They have access to manage and authorize users (Hotel Admins and Clients).
  
## Hotel Admin
The **Hotel Admin** plays a pivotal role in managing the specific hotel they are responsible for. Their functions include:

## Clients/Users
**Clients/Users** are individuals seeking to book hotel accommodations through the system. Their experience includes:

- **Browse Hotels:** Clients can browse a list of available hotels within the system.
- **View Hotel Rooms:** They have the ability to view room options within a specific hotel, complete with details and photos.
- **Place Bookings:** Clients can reserve rooms of their choice within their preferred hotel.
